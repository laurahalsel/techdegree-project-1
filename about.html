        <h2>It all started...</h2>
        <p>Well, let' see. I was adopted at 4 years old, shipped to the Americas from Thailand. Unfortunately, I will never know my birth parents because I was dumped in front of a hospital. Don't fee sad though. I was adopted by a great family who have allowed me to try anything I wanted. I was always the artsy fartsy type. I would make puppets out of cardboards, run around pretending to be Simba, and drawing whatever I imagined. </p>
        <p>Let's fast forward to when I went to college. As stated before, I changed my majors three times. I majored in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Criminal Justice</li>
          <li>Social Work</li>
          <li>and Communication Design a.k.a. graphic design</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <p>How I ended up taking this techdegree course? I can tell you it took a lot of exploring. I started out at your typical retail jobs, thought I wanted to be a chef but ditched that idea in a couple months. I have worked at many places, excelling at those places, but just not finding my nitch. You are always told:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Graduate high school</li>
          <li>Go to college</li>
          <li>Find your dream job</li>
          <li>Get married and have 2.5 kids</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And in that order. I'm still working on number three.  Number four will happen just not the kid part.</p>
        <p>Although I may have had several jobs, it only allowed me to have gain invaluable experience. I am currently a Production Designer at a small ad agency and I plan to move to Oregon one day.</p>
