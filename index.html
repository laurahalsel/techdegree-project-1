        <h2>The History</h2>

        <p>I'll be honest here. I'm not sure what I really want to do. I graduated high school a year early and went straight to college. I have changed my major three times ending up learning development. I graduated with a degree in graphic design and decided to go back to school to receive my associates in Web Development. I'd like to mix my two skills to become a great front end developer, but who knows where I'll be in 5 years...</p>
        <p>I have experience in design where I was a production designer for two ad agencies. Here I wasn't given the title of a graphic designer, because I knew a bit of programming. This has given me the opportunity to get my hands dirty with a bit of HTML, CSS, Coldfusion, JavaScript, and other languages. Now I would never consider myself an expert in any of these languages. Heck, I'm still a newbie to all of this, but I have to say I'm really excited to learn.</p>
